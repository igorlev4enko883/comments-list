In this task we are going to implement comment list with ability to create new one. 
For this task you would need to simulate API. Just write function in separate js file and use timeout to simulate async request.
Hours spend on this task will be compensated for candidate, that will be selected for job.

**Acceptance criteria**:

* Form for creating comments
* Simulate async request when sending comment to the api with timeout function(give 1.5 second timeout).
* Validation should be done in simulated function(it should simulate backend validation error)
* Handle error on frontend and show error on UI.
* If comment more then 25 symbols then show error
* List of comments
* Use Design.png for reference
* When finished create pull request or fork


**What matters**:

* Following Acceptance criteria
* Clean code
* Clean html/scss
* UI/UX quality
* Clean structure of files
* Code styling/Naming
* Reusability of components
* Redux usage(actions, reducers, etc)

**What's not that important**:
